# Data Structure and Algorithm in Python
## I. Linked Lists

- Sequence of data connected through links.
- Each element, called node, has two parts: Data and pointer to the next element. 
- Used to implement other data structures:
    -Stacks
    -Queues
    -Graphs
- Access information by navigating backward and forward
    -Web Browser
    -Music Playlist

### Operations:
1. Insert at beginning
2. Remove at beginning
3. Insert at end
4. Remove at end
5. Insert at position
6. Remove at position
7. Search

## II. Big O notation

- Measure the worst case complexity of an algorithm.
- Does not use seconds/bytes.

### Simplifying Big O notation

1. Remove constants
2. Different variables for different inputs
3. Remove smaller terms

## III. Stack

- Last In First Out (LIFO) type
- Push and pop operation 

#### LifoQueue: (Like Stack)
- Python's queue module
- Needs to import queue
