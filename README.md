# Data Structure and Algorithm in Python
## I. Linked Lists

- Sequence of data connected through links.
- Each element, called node, has two parts: Data and pointer to the next element.

### Real uses: 
- To implement other data structures:
    -Stacks
    -Queues
    -Graphs
- Access information by navigating backward and forward
    -Web Browser
    -Music Playlist

### Operations:
1. Insert at beginning
2. Remove at beginning
3. Insert at end
4. Remove at end
5. Insert at position
6. Remove at position
7. Search

## II. Big O notation

- Measure the worst case complexity of an algorithm.
- Does not use seconds/bytes.

### Simplifying Big O notation

1. Remove constants
2. Different variables for different inputs
3. Remove smaller terms
